# David Foster Wallace

Itâ€™s got something to do with love. 
With having the discipline to talk 
out of the part of yourself that 
can love instead of the part that
just wants to be loved.

# Ludwig Wittgenstein

The limits of my language means the 
limit of my world.

# Marcus Aurelius

Very little is needed to make a 
happy life; it is all within 
yourself, in your way of thinking.
